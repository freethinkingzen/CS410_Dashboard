# Seismic Activity Dashboard

## Dashboard for CS410/510 Front End Web Development at Portland State University.
<br>
This dashboard presents an overview of seismic activity and provides graphs and related information for further insights.
This should be a one stop for the average user who will not need to go any further than the dashboard but will provide 
increased detail for users interested in exploring the data or seeking specific information.
<br> 
Currently we are using the information provided by the [USGS GeoJSON API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) for our dashboard.
